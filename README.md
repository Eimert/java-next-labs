# Java.next labs

This repository contains exercises (and solutions) to get started with new features in Java 9 and later.

Make sure Java 10 is installed: http://jdk.java.net/10/
You can find the JavaDoc for Java 10 at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/overview-summary.html

Using an IDE such as [Eclipse Photon](https://www.eclipse.org/photon/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) is possible, but not required.
An IDE sometimes obscures what's really happening, especially when learning about modules where new compilation flags are introduced.

Each individual directory contains further instructions for the exercises.
